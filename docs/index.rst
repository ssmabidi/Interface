Welcome to Testbench for UAVs's documentation!
==============================================

The project Testbench for UAVs is an opensource project written as a part of Research and Development (RnD) project for Autonomous Systems (MSc) studies at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (H-BRS). This project presents a testbench for UAVS. It can be used to test different datasets with different algorithms. Currently it supports 2 datasets and 1 algorithm but it can be easily extended by implementing the interfaces it provides.
